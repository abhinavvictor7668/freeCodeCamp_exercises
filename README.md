# freeCodeCamp Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. Each project demonstrates different aspects of data analysis, visualization, and prediction using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

## Projects

### 1. Medical Examination Analysis
- **File**: `medical exam.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `medical exam.csv`
- **Description**: Analysis of medical examination data to explore relationships between various health metrics and cardiovascular disease.
- **Features**:
  - Visualization of categorical health variables
  - Analysis of cholesterol, glucose levels, and BMI
  - Correlation between lifestyle factors (smoking, alcohol, activity) and cardiovascular disease
  - Uses Seaborn for advanced data visualization

### 2. Forum Page Time Series Analysis
- **File**: `views time series.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `forumpage views.csv`
- **Description**: Time series analysis of forum page views to identify patterns and trends in user engagement.
- **Features**:
  - Time series data visualization
  - Pattern recognition in page views
  - Multiple visualization approaches for time-based data
  - Detailed analysis using line plots and statistical measures

### 3. Sea Levels Predictor
- **File**: `sea levels predictor.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `sea levels.csv`
- **Description**: Analysis and prediction of sea level changes over time using historical data.
- **Features**:
  - Linear regression analysis
  - Sea level trend visualization
  - Future sea level predictions
  - Statistical analysis of historical sea level data

## Technologies Used
